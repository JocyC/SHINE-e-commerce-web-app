#### Graphic design resources:

- Fonts: Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com/)
- Color palette ideas: Coolors (https://coolors.co/)
- Pictures: Pexel (https://www.pexels.com/)
- Logo design app: Figma (https://www.figma.com/)

Currently there would only be front-end design. But I will add back-end functionalities later once I finish learning Node.js and MongoDB.
